# Runbooks

## The Manifesto

- We are tired of haphazardly hunting through messy threads of GitHub issues and StackOverflow when we hit a problem

- We don't want a one-off fix, we want to deepen our understanding of the problem space

## What

A collection of step by step guides for fixing common tech problems. The goal here is to use this as another avenue for reaching customers.

The content is published [here](https://containersolutions.github.io/runbooks/)

## Requirements

### Git-LFS

Git was never created to store large binary files. Doing so will bloat the repository quite a bit so Github created Git LFS for to address this issue.
So to work with this repository you will need this installed on your system (although really you should already be using it for other projects where
binary files are used).

Instructions for installing LFS can be found here:

https://git-lfs.github.com/


### Submodules

Hugo uses submodule for themes so when you are cloning this repository you should pass the `--recursive` flag:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ContainerSolutions/runbooks.git
```

## Running hugo locally

### Docker

If you have docker compose installed you can simply call and you should see the blog at http://localhost:1313/runbooks/

```
docker-compose up
```

#### Local Install (runs really fast)

First [install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) then from this repository run:

```
hugo serve -D
```
