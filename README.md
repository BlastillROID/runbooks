Requirements

Git was never created to store large binary files. Doing so will bloat the repository quite a bit so Github created Git LFS for to address this issue.
So to work with this repository you will need this installed on your system (although really you should already be using it for other projects where
binary files are used).

Instructions for instaling LFS can be found here:
