# Runbooks

## The Manifesto

- We are tired of haphazardly hunting through messy threads of GitHub issues and StackOverflow when we hit a problem

- We don't want a one-off fix, we want to deepen our understanding of the problem space

## What

A collection of step by step guides for fixing common tech problems.

The content is published [here](https://containersolutions.github.io/runbooks/)
