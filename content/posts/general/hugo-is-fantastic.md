Hugo is a static site generator, written in Go which is very easy for anybody to use.

## Features

The normal stuff
* super fast (this page regenerates in about 3-18 ms on my laptop)
* supports markdown with syntax highlighting

```ruby
10.times do |iteration|
  puts "There is syntax highlighting built in :)"
end
```

## Shortcodes

One of the best features is that allows us to add special tags called "shortcodes":

```md
{{</* youtube 2xkNJL4gJ9E */>}}
```

Output:

{{< youtube 2xkNJL4gJ9E >}}

See the other [builtin shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes)


## Custom shortcodes

Adding your own your shortcode components is also super simple with just a sprinkle of HTML.

Lets create one for calling out to the [Robohash](https://robohash.org/) service. It will allow us to pass any string and get back a unique robot for that string. [[more info on creating shortcodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu4zSaKOY4A&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3&index=22)]

```html
<!--
  contents of layouts/shortcodes/robot.html...
  note the `{{.Get 0}}` fetches the first argument
-->
<img
  src="https://robohash.org/{{.Get 0}}.png?bgset=bg1"
  class="br-100 dib shadow-5"
  style="width: auto;"
  alt="Autogenerated robot for the string `{{.Get 0}}`"
/>
```

That's it. Then you can use this component in any of your posts e.g.

```md
{{</* robot "Kelsey Hightower" */>}}

{{</* robot "Bjørn Erik Pedersen" */>}}
```

Ouput:

{{< robot "Kelsey Hightower" >}}

and:

{{< robot "Bjørn Erik Pedersen" >}}

## Get started

First [install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) then:

```shell
# Download this repository and navigate to it:
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ContainerSolutions/runbooks.git && cd runbooks

# Run the server. Note: the command will output a url for you:
hugo serve -D

# Try making a new runbook:

```
