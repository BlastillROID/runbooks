## The Manifesto

- We are tired of haphazardly hunting through messy threads of GitHub issues and StackOverflow when we hit a problem
- We don't want a one-off fix, we want to deepen our understanding of the problem space
- We want to give people a resource where they can benefit from our experience without taking up our time

## What Is A Runbook?

For this site, a Runbook:

- Deals with a _defined problem_
- Provides _clear and complete steps_ for investigating, diagnosing, and fixing the problem
- Provides _useful and relevant background information_ for understanding the problem space
- _Encapsulates prior experience_ of dealing with the problem
